This function takes file location and status as input and updates the progress log for the same by adding time stamp. 

##Installation

```{r }
#install_github('surilakshay/zsfunctions/ZSfunctions')
#library(ZSfunctions)
```

## Features

The progress file should be a .csv file and data.table package must be installed prior to using this function.
Time stamp acts as the key to the log data and progress status tells what was the status for that particular iteration in the log.
