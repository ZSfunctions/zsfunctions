## How to access the repository

In the subsequent links you'd find the custom packages and functions available for use. Each function has been demonstrated using some examples, just to make the utility of the function more clear and understandable. For each function the URL has been specified from where the code can be downloaded and embedded in RStudio. 

## Prerequisites

Library(devtools) must be installed prior to accessing these functions. Since the packages are being downloaded via a GitHub source, devtools package is mandatory to install.
Also, some functions require access to some particular CRAN packages, the list of which would be defined in the markdown of that function. Those CRAN packages should be installed prior to using that particular function.
